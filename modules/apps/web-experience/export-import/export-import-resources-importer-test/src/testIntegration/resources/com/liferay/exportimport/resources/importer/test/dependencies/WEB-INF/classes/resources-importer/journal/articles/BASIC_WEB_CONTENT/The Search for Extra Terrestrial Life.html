				<p>The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence may be a good thing, or it may be a bad thing. On the one hand, if there's more life out there, wouldn't we want to get in touch with it? On the other hand, if you've seen enough sci-fi movies, you'll know that alien life might not be friendly.</p>

				<p>The best case scenario would be how Star Trek presents first contact. Other benevolent races contact earth and seek to share technology with us, once we've reached a certain level ourselves.</p>

				<p>The worst case scenario would be Independence Day. Extremely advanced and very unfriendly aliens make contact and seek to steal our resources and subjugate us.</p>

				<p>Either way, if someone's out there looking for us, they will eventually find us--in addition to various unmanned vessels that we've launched, a century's worth of radio and television broadcasts have leaked out and are traveling out into the far reaches of space. Somewhere out there, a Martian is complaining that he's already seen these Seinfeld reruns.</p>
